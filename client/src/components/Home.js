      <p className="mt-4 text-lg mb-7">THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA </p>
      <p className="mt-4 mb-7">In the United States, every driver must have a valid driver's license issued by their state of residence. The license must be carried at all times while driving, and drivers must be prepared to present it to law enforcement if requested. Additionally, the license must be valid for the type of vehicle being operated, such as a car, motorcycle, or commercial vehicle. Temporary visitors or new residents may be allowed to drive with an out-of-state or foreign license for a limited time before needing to obtain a local one.</p>
      <p className="mt-4 mb-7">Every vehicle on the road must be registered with the state and display valid license plates. Registration typically needs to be renewed annually or biennially, depending on state laws, and proof of registration must be kept in the vehicle. Failure to display up-to-date registration or driving with expired plates can result in fines. Some states also require vehicles to undergo periodic inspections to ensure they meet safety and emissions standards.</p>
      <p className="mt-4 mb-7" >Insurance is mandatory in all 50 states, though the specific requirements for coverage levels may vary. At a minimum, liability insurance is required to cover damages in the event of an accident. Some states also require additional coverage, such as uninsured motorist protection or personal injury protection (PIP). Drivers must always carry proof of insurance and present it during traffic stops or accidents.</p>
      <p className="mt-4 mb-7">States have different regulations for equipment that vehicles must have, such as seat belts, functioning lights, and airbags. Some states require additional safety features like child safety seats for younger passengers or helmets for motorcyclists. Failure to comply with these safety equipment laws can lead to citations. In some regions, specific seasonal requirements, such as snow tires or chains, may apply during winter months.</p>
